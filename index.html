         <h2>Biography</h2>
         <p>
            My name is Adeola Ogunsanya, a passionate learner with a background in basic web 
            development and a keen interest in technology. I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, 
            and have always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world 
            problems.

         <h2>Why I Joined ALT School</h2>
         <p>
            I joined the ALT School of Engineering program to gain practical, 
            hands-on skills in cloud engineering. The program's focus on real-world 
            projects and industry-relevant tools aligns perfectly with my desire to 
            transition into a career as a full-stack developer. I was particularly drawn 
            to ALT School's flexible learning model, which allows me to balance my 
            studies with other responsibilities while building a strong foundation in coding.
